# odin-recipes
Odin recipes project
This is the first website I create using the knowledge I accumulated so far from the Odin Project.
Created an index and 3 additional pages.
Headings, links, images and unordered lists were used in the index page.
Headings, images, unordered & ordered lists as well as a few paragraphs were used in the 3 recipe pages.
The images attached have the style attribute so they can fit in the page.
